# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges
I couldn't get a picture to load using the formatting of a URL from any site, until I found a URL that referenced only a .png file. The difference seemed to be that the URLs I was trying were to websites that contained the images, but were not the direct URLs to the image file only. Once I realized the difference I inspected the site to grab the source file that the site referenced, and that worked. I wanted to see if it would work with a .gif and it did! Sorry.

## Screenshot
Add a screenshot of your rendered component (you can drag and drop it here if using GitHub web interface).
